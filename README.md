# Learn_Visualization_on_Matplotlib
## Matplotlib 
+ The Figure is the overall window or page that everything is drawn on.
+  It’s the top-level component of all. To the figure you add Axes. 
+  The Axes is the area on which the data is plotted. 
+  A figure can have multiple axes. Note: when you see, for example, plt.xlim, you’ll call ax.set_xlim() behind the covers.  
+  All methods of an Axes object exist as a function in the pyplot module and vice versa. Mostly, you’ll use the functions of the pyplot module because they’re much cleaner, at least for simple plots!
### Method I
### Method II
+ When you want to control individual elements
+ Example
+ ax.set_xlabel('Some Label', size=25)
+ Using the pyplot methods
### Sub Plots
### Categorical Vs Numeric
+ Bar Chart
+ Horizontal Bar Chart
+ Pie Chart
### Input Data: Univariate (1D Series)
+ Histogram
+  BoxPlot
### Input Data: Bivariate (2D Series)
